\tOverview\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Spring AI project aims to streamline the development of applications that incorporate artificial intelligence functionality without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe project draws inspiration from notable Python projects, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, but Spring AI is not a direct port of those projects.\nThe project was founded with the belief that the next wave of Generative AI applications will not be only for Python developers but will be ubiquitous across many programming languages.\n\n\t\n\n\t\nSpring AI addresses the fundamental challenge of AI integration: Connecting your enterprise Data and APIs with AI Models.\n\nInteractive\n\nSpring AI provides abstractions that serve as the foundation for developing AI applications.\nThese abstractions have multiple implementations, enabling easy component swapping with minimal code changes.\n\nSpring AI provides the following features:\n\n\t\nPortable API support across AI providers for Chat, text-to-image, and Embedding models. Both synchronous and streaming API options are supported. Access to model-specific features is also available.\n\n\t\nSupport for all major AI Model providers such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Ollama. Supported model types include:\n\n\t\nChat Completion\n\n\t\nEmbedding\n\n\t\nText to Image\n\n\t\nAudio Transcription\n\n\t\nText to Speech\n\n\t\nModeration\n\n\t\nStructured Outputs - Mapping of AI Model output to POJOs.\n\n\t\nSupport for all major Vector Database providers such as Apache Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Vector Search, Chroma, Elasticsearch, GemFire, MariaDB, Milvus, MongoDB Atlas, Neo4j, OpenSearch, Oracle, PostgreSQL/PGVector, PineCone, Qdrant, Redis, SAP Hana, Typesense and Weaviate.\n\n\t\nPortable API across Vector Store providers, including a novel SQL-like metadata filter API.\n\n\t\nTools/Function Calling - Permits the model to request the execution of client-side tools and functions, thereby accessing necessary real-time information as required and taking action.\n\n\t\nObservability - Provides insights into AI-related operations.\n\n\t\nDocument ingestion ETL framework for Data Engineering.\n\n\t\nAI Model Evaluation - Utilities to help evaluate generated content and protect against hallucinated response.\n\n\t\nSpring Boot Auto Configuration and Starters for AI Models and Vector Stores.\n\n\t\nChatClient API - Fluent API for communicating with AI Chat Models, idiomatically similar to the WebClient and RestClient APIs.\n\n\t\nAdvisors API - Encapsulates recurring Generative AI patterns, transforms data sent to and from Language Models (LLMs), and provides portability across various models and use cases.\n\n\t\nSupport for Chat Conversation Memory and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n\nThis feature set lets you implement common use cases, such as “Q&A over your documentation” or “Chat with your documentation.”\n\nThe concepts section provides a high-level overview of AI concepts and their representation in Spring AI.\n\nThe Getting Started section shows you how to create your first AI application.\nSubsequent sections delve into each component and common use cases with a code-focused approach.\n\n  AI Concepts\n\n                      \t\n\n                          Spring AI\n\n                              Stable\n\n  \t\n\n      1.0.0\n\n                              Snapshot\n\n  \t\n\n      1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n  \t\n    Related Spring Documentation\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Boot\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Framework\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Cloud\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Build\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Bus\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Commons\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Config\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Consul\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Contract\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Function\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Gateway\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Kubernetes\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Netflix\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud OpenFeign\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Stream\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Task\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Vault\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Cloud Zookeeper\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Data\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Cassandra\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Commons\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Couchbase\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Elasticsearch\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data JPA\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data KeyValue\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data LDAP\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data MongoDB\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Neo4j\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data Redis\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data JDBC & R2DBC\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Data REST\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Integration\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Batch\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Security\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Authorization Server\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring LDAP\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Security Kerberos\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Session\n\n    \t\n\n  Spring Vault\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring AI\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring AMQP\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring CLI\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring GraphQL\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring for Apache Kafka\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Modulith\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring for Apache Pulsar\n\n        \t\n\n  Spring Shell\n\nAll Docs...\n\n        Copyright © 2005 -  Broadcom.
